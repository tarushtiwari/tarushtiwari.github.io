Work experience
======
* PROJECT| Steady-state photon transport in QED lattices.
-----
Supervisor: Dr. Rajeev Singh, IIT (BHU), Varanasi ()
  * Theoretically analyzed tight binding and cavity QED lattices modelled as inter-acting bosonic qubits medium with photonic baths using the truncated Heisenberg-Langevin equations.
  * Studied the steady-state photon transport through this model at various parameters.
  * Built approximate models for the systems using the quasi-classical and themean-field approximation methods.
  * Suggested modifications in the approximate analyses to get better results.

* MASTERS THESIS| Characterization of Thermophilic bacteria from Manikaranhot springs.
-----
Supervisor: Dr. Ashish Kumar Singh, IIT (BHU), Varanasi ()
  * Determining the growth characteristics of the unknown bacteria sample.
  * Determining the various bio-chemical characteristics of the bacteria.
  * Isolating the genomic DNA of the bacteria and acquire its sequence for further characterization.
