------
Ph.D. in Physics.

* *Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi (U.P.), India*
------
Integrated Dual Degree (B. Tech. and M.Tech.) in Biochemical Engineering and Biotechnology.(<strong>Graduated in 2020</strong>)

Research experience
======
* <strong>Project|</strong> *Steady-state photon transport in QED lattices.(May 2019- May 2020)*<br>
	Supervisor: Dr. Rajeev Singh, IIT (BHU), Varanasi 
  * Theoretically analyzed tight binding and cavity QED lattices modelled as inter-acting bosonic qubits medium with photonic baths using the truncated Heisenberg-Langevin equations.
  * Studied the steady-state photon transport through this model at various parameters.
  * Built approximate models for the systems using the quasi-classical and themean-field approximation methods.
  * Suggested modifications in the approximate analyses to get better results.
<br>
* <strong>Masters Thesis|</strong> *Characterization of Thermophilic bacteria from Manikaranhot springs.(January 2019- May 2020)*<br>
	Supervisor: Dr. Ashish Kumar Singh, IIT (BHU), Varanasi 
  * Determining the growth characteristics of the unknown bacteria sample.
  * Determining the various bio-chemical characteristics of the bacteria.
  * Isolating the genomic DNA of the bacteria and acquire its sequence for further characterization.
