A brief history of mine
======
I was born in the sweet humble town of Bhilai, Chhattisgargh in India but soon shifted to Bhopal in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. I finished my schooling from the Campion School, Bhopal in 2014 and joined the Indian Instittute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varaansi for my undergraduate and masters degree in Biochemical Engineering. However, my interests made me take a turn and shift to pursue research in physics, especially in quantum information, which has been my area of interest ever since. In September 2021, I started my PhD in Pysics at Umass Lowell. Apart from academia, I have served as the joint secretary of the [Astronomy Club, IIT BHU ](https://astroiitbhu.in/) in the session 2017-18. I also enjoy playing football(soccer) and support Manchester United in the English Premier League.
