<h2> Photon transport through QED lattices. </h2>
<p>
Understanding the dynamics of light propagation through a lattice of one-dimensioal qubits is an important problem in open quantum systems' research. In this theoretical work, the qubits were modelled as two level systems using a Bose-Hubbard type model with strong on-site interaction. The transmission probability of photons through the lattice is calculated using a truncated Heisenberg-Langevin equations (THLE) as well as a quasi-classical approximation(QCA) approach. With increasing photon intensity, the THLE approach shows a reduced photon transmission due to the non-linearity in the qubits cresulting in decoupling between the baths and the lattice medium. The effect was observed in two different lattice systems (see image). The QCA approach, however, failed to accurately capture the decoupling effects. To remedy this, a modification in the quasi-classical equations is introduced which is to use an on-site interaction term. The modification was succesfull for most parameters. <IMG SRC=”images/500x300.png” ALIGN=”right” />
